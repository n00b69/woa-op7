# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Mi 8

## Troubleshooting Issues
> Below you will find a list of common problems and their solutions

## LTE and other network services in Android no longer work
> Sometimes Windows may wipe your modem partitions, resulting in the loss of LTE in Android. To fix this, you'll need to restore your modem using the backups that you hopefully made [while partitioning your device](1-partition.md#backing-up-important-files). If you did not do this step, there is likely no way to recover.
- Boot into any recovery other than the stock recovery (ADB commands do not work there)
- Open CMD in the **platform-tools** folder.
- Restore the four partitions that you backed up using the below commands. Replace `path\to` with the actual path of the images.
```cmd
adb push path\to\fsc.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/fsc.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/fsc
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\fsg.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/fsg.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/fsg
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\modemst1.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/modemst1.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/modemst1
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\modemst2.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/modemst2.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/modemst2
```
- Reboot your device and check if LTE works.
> [!Note]
> If it still does not work, you will have to do some additional steps;
- Download the [stock rom for your device](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/miui/dipper/)
- Open it, look for a file called **modem.img** and extract it.
- Boot into fastboot mode (`adb reboot bootloader`).
- Flash this **modem.img** with the below command, replacing `path\to\modem.img` with the actual path of the image
```cmd
fastboot flash modem path\to\modem.img
```

## Cannot mount Windows in Android
If mounting Windows produces an empty folder, you either don't have Windows installed, or your rom does not have mount support.

##### Finished!

## Cannot write to Windows in Android
> This is caused by shutting down Windows instead of restarting it.
- To solve this, boot to Windows and then press "restart", then as the screen shuts off boot to TWRP and from there load up Android.
- Or, disable hibernation in Windows. 
> Alternatively, if you have already set up the Switch to Android app, simply use this to switch to Android.

##### Finished!

## USB does not work
Enable USB host mode using the optional [post install guide](materials.md#toggling-usb-host-mode).

##### Finished!

## DISM Error:87 The add-driver option is unkown
This usually means that you have an unclean Windows image with some other drivers. You need to get a clean Windows image (which means you didn't follow instructions).

##### Finished!

## 0xc000021a BSOD
This usually means that winlogon.exe has failed, and you may need to reapply the Windows image.

##### Finished!

## The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error
If you stumble upon this error, you may need to redeploy the Windows image. Use the [reinstall guide](reinstall.md) for this.

##### Finished!

## INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD
This Blue Screen of Death likely means some broken driver installation. To fix this, reinstall the drivers using the [reinstall guide](reinstall.md).
