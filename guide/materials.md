- Open a command prompt window and run ```diskpart```
- Run ```list volume``` to see all available volumes
- Select the disk that has letter D with ```select volume $```, replacing "$" with the volume number
- Remove the letter with ```remove letter d```
- Exit diskpart with ```exit```

### Toggling USB host mode

Run [USB Host Control](https://github.com/Misha803/My-Scripts/releases/tag/USB-Host-Mode-Control) to enable/disable USB host mode, then confirm that you want to disable/enable USB host mode.
